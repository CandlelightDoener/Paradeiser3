### developing a hybrid app ###

Background:
Apache Cordova emerged from PhoneGap. It's a library which lets you write apps in Html5+JS+CSS and does the wrapping
to native code for you. If you install it via node.js, it also helps you set up projects from scratch. If you use
IntelliJ or Eclipse, you can just build&run the app from your IDE, either on an Emulator or a real Android Device.

Very helpful:
Setup from scratch: http://cordova.apache.org/docs/en/3.1.0/guide_cli_index.md.html#The%20Command-line%20Interface
Which phones (or emulators) are attached? call "adb devices"
Want to use real Android Device? http://developer.android.com/tools/device.html

Prerequisites:
Node.js, Android SDK Manager, Ant, (OS-Driver for your Android phone)

Avoiding Pitfalls:
+ Have sdk\tools, sdk\platform-tools and apache-ant-x.y.z\bin in your $PATH
+ AndroidManifest.xml:
  - add android:debuggable="true" to <application ...>
  - set <uses-sdk android:minSdkVersion="xx"/> to 15 or something similarly low
+ Before using real phone:
  - download OS-driver
  - set phone to debug mode
  - set development sdk of project to whatever sdk your phone runs (install in Android SDK Manager first)
+ Before using emulator:
  - create an AVD in Android SDK Manager and start it
